                    <div>Hi Sruthi,
The only reason you're reading this is that you couldn't find time to see me in person
i would really love to tell all of this to you in person but i guess circumstances didnt let us meet

There is so much i want to say but i dont know where to start
you say its over, but
for you?
a thousand times over
i still love you despite everything
I love you , but i dont understand you

when someone asks me at what time i am the happiest, my mind would instantly go back to the time when we were still together

i look for you everywhere, i find you in everything, i see things that remind me of you, that remind me of us

now im jealous of every couple i see, why dont i deserve such happiness i thought,
but then i realized that that must have gone through tough times too but they stuck to each other and fixed it

now i cant even go to that mall and stay calm, every corner i see remnants of us

you were my first love and my first heartbreak and i dont think i need a second one for either of those

i know that i deserve better treatment but i dont want a better person, because it is not a healthy relationship i crave for, its a healthy and happy sruthi.

you felt like home, the home i'd run to after college, the home that comforted me, the home i'd long for when things fall apart, when im in immense joy, when i wanted to cry

i hate hate hate it when you disappear for hours without notice 
but i need to understand that you are not me, you have other close friends who you share and talk to, but i just had you, i would never make you wait because im talking to someone else, because that is me

im clingy, im obsessed with you, im silly, im stupid, im weird, im goofy, i try to act nonchalant but i love to yap yap yap and yap,  i overthink a lot, i do get jealous very easily, i do have anxiety, i do feel lonely, i do have attachment issues, i do need assurances, i do love to too much
i do want you more than anybody else 

if someone ever asks me where i would like to be rn i would say a place where me and you are talking or just enjoying our presence and company.

now whenever i read a horoscope i read for taurus too, whenever i see something related to months i read for april too.

i see your flaws, i see your mistakes, i see your strength, i see your kindness, i see the real you , i love everything about you, i love you for all you are

meeting you as been the best thing that ever happened to me in my life

for once in my life i felt like somebody wanted me, somebody enjoys my existense and that they love me despite my flaws, i felt happy, immense joy

i felt that when youre there with me i'll get through anything i face

i miss talking to you properly with normal long coversations not the ones where you send a message and not reply for several hours

i miss your laughter, i miss calling you everyday, i miss you.

my favourite part of the day was when i get to go home from that shitty college with shitty and boring people, go home shut my door and talk to the love of my life as if there is no tomm, and another fav is when we told each other i love yous and the copycats thats the cutest thing ever

we'll have our good days and our bad days but guess what i want you the most on either of those days. you think that i dont deserve you and that i deserve better but let me tell you, i know you made mistakes but making mistakes is not a mistake and making mistakes does not make you a bad person, one incident does not make you a bad person, one mistake does not define you, you are defined by how you change as a person after making those mistakes, whats important is to learn from your mistakes and try to be a better and more mature then what we used to be, so lets try that? 

you may feel like you're not perfect for me and that you're not the one for me, but 
Nobody is perfect, so ill fill in your gaps and you will fill in mine and together we can be perfect together, and i love you're imperfections because those are what makes you, YOU and i love you for who you are so let me love what you dont see in yourself
i dont think you understand how beautiful and colourful you make my world

i hope to be the constant in your life, the one you dont replace the one wh stays no matter who may come and go the one you can always rely on

youre safe here with me, you can tell me anythinggg in the world and ill be down to listen
when life gets hard im there for you, when you feel like falling ill have your back

but now you act as if uo and i never happened, i wonder do you think about me some nights, do you ever think of what we could have been. please dont forget me and all the things we did,now i miss you more than i remember you, it kills me to know that it wont ever be the same again but thats ok with me ill change too.

but seriously did you forget all the i love yous? all the times when you asked me to wait for you until you get out of your house? all the i miss yous? all the times you said i was your favourite person? all the times you asked me to bare with you and your parents? all the i need you right nows? all the i want to kiss yous? all the thankyou for listenings?the "thankyou for making me find myself"? the "please bear with me and nagu for the next 2 years until i finish 12th"? all the hiiii babys? all the you know me so wells? all the i love you the mosts? all the ill never leave yous?

idk if you remember or not in the letter i wrote before i told you about the invisible string and that we are connected by it and that it may tangle here and there but it never breaks
rn we are tangled, why dont we slowly try to untangle it while also working on ourselves

im sorry for assuming that you didnt care about me, that you have become cold and distant
im sorry
i know youre hurting too thats why you did the things you did
you did them because it affected you so much because you cared so much
im sorry if i didnt give you space, im sorry if i kept bugging you and im sorry if i suffocated you with too much love.

you said that we made a mistake by catching feelings and that we should have just stayed as friends. if loving you was a mistake, i would make that mistake every single day, in every lifetime, in every universe, i'd make that mistake. because youre worth it, youre worth all the trouble, youre worth all the heartbreak, youre worth all my efforts. 
let it out. tell me whats on your mind. tell me every mistake that you did and watch me still stay, watch me still love you. tell me the worst things you did aand i'd listem and pay attention because that. is. who. i. am.

now that you have changed so much, it makes me even curious to know more about you, i want to know every little thing about you, i want to love you to the fullest i can

i read this somewhere before and it says
"every word i ever say to you is just another feeble attemp to tell you that i love you,
are you hungry? i love you
how was your day? i love you
guess what happened just now? i love you
show me what youre doing? i love you"
and i very highly resonate with that because that is who i am.

if nobody believes in you i will.
and im proud of you for accepting your mistakes and calling me that night
that was very mature of you, and im proud of you for trying to change and be better
are you proud of yourself?

if everybody leaves ill stay by your side, youre the best thing that ever happened to me 
i still hug my pillows thinking its you, you bring me comfort, you are my pillow

i didnt like how you gave up on me so easily, was i that easy to let go? was i that insignificant in your life? was i that much of a ghost?
i didnt like how you gave up on me because of tough situations,
good and proper relationships are not good and proper because they have 0 problems
they are that way because both of them worked it out TOGETHER.
and i am always ready to work it out with you too
relationships are more than just walking away when things get tough

youre the first person i opened up to, you will always be the person i run to, but now youre not there to accept me. youre the first person i loved and the first person i have genuinely cared for so much and youre also the first person i cried for, to me , you are my person sruthi.

i still know all of your favs and i cant forget them
fav colour?olive green
fav flower?coreopsis
fav kdrama? hometown cha cha cha
fav cartoon show? miraculous
fav character in that show? chloe
fav episode in that show? oblivio

loovvvvvess kdramas 
loves vaseline and lipstick

your love language is physical touch but its sad that we cant meet much


we can always still focus on ourselves, cope with family problems and pressures and still not give up on each other, i wanted to make things work. i didnt want to give up on you. 
everyone thinks im soooooo desperate for you but little do they know what type of a person you are, they dont know how happy you made me feel, how healed my inner child was with you, they dk how loved i felt for the first time in my life, why would i let go of that and move on and search for someone else, why would i do that?

its okay if youre complicated, its okay if youre messed up, i will always stay 
man i cheered for you and tried to make you feel better in the shit you were going through, whenever you were upset, whenever your parents scolded, whenever you were mad at lucky, i always lended my ear to you to listen and liek pay attention to what youre saying,
in july start i was there for you when you started to push me away and get distant, i was there while i was hurting too, you meant that much to me sruthi

wow you should have look at my face, jumoing up and down just because you said you would play roblox with me, my god why do i just love this girl so much.

im a bit confusing, i know. i ask you to be better but i say i love you for who you are, but nobody wants to be treated like that, nobody wants their loved one to be an asshole to them 

i didnt fall in love with you because i was lonely or desperate for love, i fell in love with you because when i bonded with you for the first time, it was the only time i wanted a person to6 be permanent in my life, till the day i die.

if you dont tell me your problems, if you dont tell about your lows and what makes you upset and what makes bothers you, if you dont tell me, then who will you tell? i am not a stranger right? im here to listen and pay attention 

i want to spend time with you, i want to laugh with you and make memories, grow together and learn more about each other and life and to go through tough and rough things together, i want to be your person, i want to be your home, i want to your boyfriend, i think im crazy for saying this but i want to your husband too.

im so so addicted to your smile, your laughs, your squeals of excitment, your gigling, your face, your eyes, your hair, your lips, you are just so majestically beautiful in every way. youre the most prettiest girl i have ever seen.
i miss the days we hung out after school, i miss the days i game to gss after my 10th ended, i miss your warm hugs, i miss the way you talked to me before, i miss the days where ik you loved me, i miss your i love yous, i miss your big paragraphs, i miss the long coversations, i miss the sweet talk, i miss the sweet girl you were but thats ok people change and i cant do anything about it, i miss calling you after college ends, i miss talking about my interest to you because you never judged me for them, i miss telling you about my day, i miss you telling about your days which you dont anymore. "good" "it was nice" "it was normal" i want to know every single thing which happened during the day, all the interesting moments, the boring moments, the funny moments, i want to know them all 
did you seriously think that you going away will make me unlove you?

April 27th, 2024-

July start- the beginning of the end????
you started ghosting me and i felt like a fucking idiot. i felt confused. i thought i did something wrong. i was panicking because i thought i was going to lose my only person. the only person i wanted to stay, im that youll leave. and unfortunately i was right.

July 21st, 2024-
D-day, the morning when i woke up and i saw that text, i thought it was a bad dream and tried sleeping again, then reality hit me like a truck, and soon enough i was in tears.
and there the crying starts, there hasn't been a day where i didn't cry till mid august, after that even tho i wanted to cry and breakdown the tears didn't fall.

September 15th,2024
you called me out of the blue, i was happy, confused, scared, excited, idk what it was but i lifted the call. and then when i heard your voice i was at peace, the stuff we talked that day it made me happy, it felt like before how it was, you said "lets get married Likhith" and i was so shocked i didn't have an answer, to all those lovely stuff you said i didn't have an answer because i was in awe, that you were not the evil person i imagined until now.


honestly before we started liking each other i thought that calling your lover 'baby' is very corny and cringe but when the first time you called me baby that cuteness overload i got, its incomparable, every time you called me cute stuff, every time you called me by my name, theyre some beautiful moments in my life

i miss you more than ever now, i miss my bestfriend, i miss my lover, i miss my pandu, i miss my tulip, i miss my sruthi

you broke up with me on 21st july,  a sunday, how do you expect me to stop loving the person i thought i'd be with till i die, how do you expect me to stop loving you on a random sunday

i hope we can meet again somewhere in the future and i hope youll fall in love with me again and i hope that we will work it out together, because idts i can ever fall out of with you
but im not keeping my hopes up high for now, i will stop thinking about what could have happened and what will happen in the future, rather i will cherish and love what did happen for it was the most beautiful thing in my life

i thought about you everyday since we started talking to each other, i still think about you everyday and ill continue to do so

im glad i got to love you, im glad youre my first and hopefully my last love, im glad youre the first person i held hands with, im glad youre my first kiss, im glad for all the memories we made and i dont intend on forgetting them ever,im glad that you made me feel safe, im glad that you gave me the safe space to talk about my feelings, my ups and downs, my anxiety. im glad that you listened to me and cared for me at one point, im glad that youre my favourite person,again i may sound crazy but im glad that i thought that you would be the person i marry

in the end, where could i rest but in your storm.

but for now i have to study for my exams, and i hope that these few months don't make us strangers
and maybe some day i will live inside your cupboard, and maybe someday youll make me rings and matching bracelets again.

i have always loved you more than i have ever found a way to express into words
can we be weird together again some day?
i miss you more than i miss the memories
ill love you forever sruthi.
